You control access to Superset data sources by using Superset roles and permissions. 

Superset has three roles mapped to BigAnimal roles:

- Gamma
- Alpha
- Admin

Learn more about Superset roles, users, and permissions management in [Superset Security](https://superset.apache.org/docs/security). 

The Superset roles map to BigAnimal permissions:

| Superset role |                                                      Description                                                       | BigAnimal permissions mapped to Superset role |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Gamma         | View data that user has been granted access to, create dashboards                                                      | Project viewer                                       |
| Alpha         | All Superset Gamma privileges, plus the ability to add or modify data sources                                          | Project editor                                  |
| Admin         | All Superset Alpha privileges, plus access to SQL Lab and the ability to grant or revoke access to data to other users | Project owner                                 |

!!! Note
    While Admin users have access to all databases by default, both Alpha and Gamma users need to be given access via the Superset sql_lab role on a per database basis. The sql_lab role grants access to SQL Lab. 

To assign BigAnimal user roles, see [Changing role permissions](01_portal_access/#assign-roles-to-users).
