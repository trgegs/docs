BigAnimal uses role-based access controls to grant users access to different parts of the application.

## Organizations

Each subscribed customer has a unique *organization*. Each organizationâ€™s database clusters are deployed and managed in the customer's cloud account. This approach ensures complete segregation of customer data between organizations.

Each BigAnimal organization is associated with an identity provider, set up by the customer. Your identity provider establishes the identity of users that belong to an organization. After an organization's identity provider is set up, users added to the identity provider can log in with minimum access privileges.

For Azure Marketplace accounts, each BigAnimal organization is associated with an Azure AD tenant. Azure AD establishes the identity of users that belong to an organization. After Azure AD is linked during subscription, users that belong to that AD can log in with minimum access privileges.

BigAnimal supports role-based access control policies. A user with the owner role can assign roles to other users in the same organization.

## Projects

Projects within an organization segregate workflows by providing secure and isolated environments. Multiple projects can be created under organizations, however you cannot move clusters between projects. 

## Roles

Access to BigAnimal is controlled by roles. Roles are sets of permissions. You use roles to manage permissions assigned to users.

Each organization and project have the following default roles available:

- Organization Owner
- Organization Admin
- Organization Member
- Project Owner
- Project Editor
- Project Viewer

There is no cap on how many users can have any role type.

### Permissions

Permissions are generally represented in the format *action*:*object* where *action* represents an operation to perform (create, read, update, and delete) and *object* represents a category of portal functionality such as projects or clusters.

!!! Note
    Not every object supports all the actions. For example, events objects are always read-only.

### Permissions by role

The following are the default permissions by role.

#### Organization roles

##### An Organization Owner:
- has permissions for all organization-level objects:
  - read permission for identity provider, org events, org roles, and org usage objects
  - read and update permission for org users and organizations (metadata) objects
  - create and update permission for projects
    - automatically gets the Project Owner role for any new project they create, but not for all new projects created by other Org Owners or for existing projects 
    - can see an organization-level usage report and activity log for all projects
- can assign or remove the Org Owner role from another Org Owner 

##### An Organization Admin:
- has read-only permissions to the Organization. 
- can see an organization-level usage report and activity log for all projects 
- cannot assign organization-level roles

An Organization Member has no permissions until another role is assigned to them.

##### Organization permissions details
| Object                   | Org Owner permissions | Org Admin permissions |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| organizations (metadata) | read, update          | read                  |
| identity provider        | read                  | read                  |
| org events               | read                  | read                  |
| org roles                | read                  | -                     |
| org usage                | read                  | read                  |
| org users                | read, update          | read                  |
| projects                 | create, update        | read                  |


#### Project roles

A Project Owner: 
- has permissions for all project-level objects:
- owns the individual project and controls what is changed and updated
- can assign Project-level roles 
- can own multiple projects 
- can toggle between the projects, if they are Project Owners for multiple projects
- can remove their own Project Owner role, but only if at least one other user is also an Project Owner for that particular project

Multiple users can have the Project Owner role for the same project.   

A **Project Editor** can read and change the project data.

A **Project Viewer** can only view a few basic pages and functions.

## Users

If you purchased BigAnimal through Azure Marketplace, when you configured your Azure subscription, you also enabled BigAnimal to authenticate users from your organization using Azure AD. Before users become visible in the BigAnimal Users screen, they need to sign in using Azure AD after receiving special emails from your organization.

If you are using your own account, you enabled BigAnimal to authenticate users from your organization using your identity provider. Before users become visible in the BigAnimal Users screen, they need to log in.

New users signed in to BigAnimal have a minimum set of permissions until you assign them a role.

### Assign roles to users

1.  Navigate to **Admin > Users**.

2.  Select the edit icon for the user.

3.  Select **Assign Roles**.

4.  Select or clear roles for the user.

5.  Select **Submit**.

!!! Note
    For a user's role assignment to take effect, the user must log out from BigAnimal and log in again.

### View users

You can view all users from your organization who have logged in at least once.

1.  Navigate to **Admin > Users**.

2.  View the list of users. You can use search to narrow the list and you can also sort it by name or email.

## Example scenario

1. Tom is the first user and changes the default project name to something that is meaningful to his organization and sets up the identity provider. He is granted the Organization and Project Owner roles.

2. Tom invites Jerry and Sally to log in through the organization's identity provider. Both of their accounts in BigAnimal are automatically created with the role of Organization Member.

3. Tom connects the organization's cloud account to BigAnimal.

1. Sally logs in but sees a blank Project page so she reaches out to Tom to get a role assigned to her.

3. Tom grants Sally the Project Editor role. She can now see the create BigAnimal clusters.

4.  Sally asks Jerry to log in and grants him the Project Editor role.

5.  Jerry can now see the clusters that Sally created and can create clusters.

## Example scenario for Azure Marketplace

1.  The BigAnimal organization is created, and Tom logs in and is granted the Organization and Project Owner role.

2.  Tom asks Jerry to log in, using his Azure AD account. Jerry's account in BigAnimal is created.

3.  Tom grants Sally the Project Editor role. Sally can now create BigAnimal clusters.

4.  Sally asks Jerry to log in and grants him the Project Editor role.

5.  Jerry can now see the clusters that Sally created and can create clusters.
