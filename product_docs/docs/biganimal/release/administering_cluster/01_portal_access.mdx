BigAnimal uses role-based access controls to grant users access to different parts of the application using organization-level and project-level roles. Roles are sets of permissions. Roles are used to manage permissions assigned to users.

Each customer has a unique BigAnimal organization. Each organization has at least one project by default; more projects can be created. An organization's database clusters are deployed and managed in the customer's cloud account within a project. Projects within an organization separate workflows to provide secure and isolated environments to ensure complete separation of customer data between different projects within an organization.

In order to access a BigAnimal organization, each user needs to be first added to the organization's identity provider. For more informations, ee [Setting up your identity provider](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/identity_provider/). Your identity provider establishes the identity of users that can log in to BigAnimal. 

Once a user has logged in to BigAnimal, you can assign them a role.
