BigAnimal uses role-based access controls to grant users access to different parts of the application using organization- and project-level roles. Roles are sets of permissions. You use roles to manage permissions assigned to users.

Each subscribed customer has a unique *organization*. Each organization can have one or more projects. Projects within an organization segregate workflows by providing secure and isolated environments. An organization's database clusters are deployed and managed in the customer's cloud account within a project. This approach ensures complete segregation of customer data between organizations and projects within organizations.

Each BigAnimal organization is associated with a default project, set up by BigAnimal, and an identity provider, set up by the customer. Your identity provider establishes the identity of users that can log in to BigAnimal. 

After a user is logged in to BigAnimal once, they can be assigned roles.

## Organization level roles
The following roles grant privileges within an organization.

- **Organization owner** &mdash; This role has management privileges to the organization, and can perform the following actions:
  - View the identity provider details of the BigAnimal subscription

  - Create and view projects within their organization
  - Update and delete their own projects
  - View and assign users to the BigAnimal organization-level roles
  - View and assign users to the BigAnimal project-level roles of which they manage
  - View the activity log for each project
  - View the usage report for all clusters deployed within their organization and generate a CSV file of the report 

  !!!noteNotes
     - The first user into the BigAnimal subscription is an organization owner and is automatically the default project owner as well. 

     - If a subsequent organization member is given an organization owner role, they only receive the organization owner role and its organization-level permissions; however, they don't automatically become a project owner. 
     - An organization owner can remove their own organization owner role, but only if at least one other user is also an organization owner. If a user has their organization owner role removed, they remain project owner for the projects they had access to.
