Projects are a group of database clusters within a BigAnimal organization. Access to projects is controlled by a user's role. See [Managing portal access](/biganimal/release/administering_cluster/01_portal_access) for more information.

Projects actions are available from the left navigation bar. The actions apply to the project in focus. You can switch between projects using the Projects menu.

## Adding a user to a project
Before adding a user to a project: 
- The user must be added through your organization's identify provider or through Azure AD.

- The user must log in to the BigAnimal portal at least once.

To add a user: 
1. Select the project you want to add a user to from the Projects menu.

1. Select Users from the left navigation bar.
2.  Select the edit icon for the user.
3.  Select **Assign Roles**.
4.  Depending on the level of access you want for the user, select the appropriate role.

5.  Select **Submit**.

!!! Note
    For a user's role assignment to take effect, the user must log out from BigAnimal and log in again.
