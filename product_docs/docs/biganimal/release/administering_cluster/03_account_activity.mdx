The activity logs collect BigAnimal events based on user activity in the portal. There is an organization-level log available users with organization roles and a project-level log. You can use the log to audit activities performed by users from your organizations or research activities that might have affected your account at either the organization level or the project level.

## Events

Events describe actions performed by users. The available actions are:

-   create
-   read
-   update
-   delete

Events are related to the following resource types:

-   cluster
-   data plane
-   user
-   user roles
-   role permissions
-   organization
-   project

!!! Note
    Database events are not logging activity on the Postgres server. They are logging the use of the portal to create or modify database clusters.

## View and search the activity log

- The organization-level activity log is available from the dropdown menu next to your organization name in the top right of the portal. 
- The project-level activity log is available from the Project menu on the left of the portal. 

To search events, use the filters at the top of the page.
