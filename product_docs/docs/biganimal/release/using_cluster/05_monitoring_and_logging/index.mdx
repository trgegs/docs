Monitoring options include:

- Viewing the metrics and logs from your cloud provider. For more information about viewing metrics and logs from your cloud provider, see:

  - [Viewing metrics and logs from Azure](monitoring_from_azure)

  - [Viewing metrics and logs from AWS](monitoring_from_aws)

  For details on the types and format of metrics available from BigAnimal see [Metrics details](metrics).

- BigAnimal provides a Prometheus-compatible endpoint you can use to connect to your own metrics infrastructure - for example, your AWS Managed Grafana and Azure Managed Grafana. For more information, see [Custom monitoring](custom_monitoring). 

- For existing Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) users who want to monitor BigAnimal clusters alongside self-managed Postgres clusters, you can use the remote monitoring capability of PEM. For more information on using PEM to monitor your clusters, see [Remote monitoring](/pem/latest/pem_admin/02a_pem_remote_monitoring).
