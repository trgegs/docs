Projects are a group of database clusters within a BigAnimal organization. Access to projects is controlled by a user's role. See [Mangaging portal access](/biganimal/release/administering_cluster/01_portal_access) for more information.

## Default project
BigAnimal creates a default project for your organization. It is created with a silly name to identify it as a project that BigAnimal created for you and that you probably haven't customized yet. The first user that logs in has the option to change the name or any user with the Project Owner or Editor role can change it later.

One you have connected to your cloud provider you can assign project roles to your project.
