You can upgrade to a patch release with a simple in place upgrade. A minor release upgrade, such as upgrading from 1.15 to 1.16, requires additional steps.

## Upgrading a minor release

To upgrade to a new minor release:

1. Stop the service for the currently installed version.
2. Install the new release.

   For Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8 on x86_64:
   ```shell
   dnf -y upgrade edb-pgbouncer<xx>
   ```
   
   !!! Note
      For RHEL8, the `dnf` command works only for minor upgrades, and not for major upgrades where the package name changes, like `edb-pgbouncer116` to `edb-pgbouncer117`. To learn how to perform a major upgrade on RHEL8, see [Upgrading a major release on RHEL8](#upgrading-a-major-release-on-rhel8).
   !!!

   For RHEL/CentOS 7 on ppc64le:
   ```shell
   yum -y upgrade edb-pgbouncer<xx>
   ```
   
   For SLES:
   ```shell
   zypper -n update edb-pgbouncer<xx>
   ```

   For Ubuntu/Debian:
   ```shell
   apt-get -y upgrade edb-pgbouncer<xx>
   ```

   Where &lt;xx> is the EDB PgBouncer minor version you want to upgrade to.

3. If you have any custom configurations in the `edb-pgbouncer.ini` and `userlist.txt` files for the previously installed version, copy them from the versions of those files where the customization were made and paste them to the corresponding files for the release you just installed.

## Upgrading a major release on RHEL8

For RHEL8, the `dnf` command doesn't work for major upgrades because the package name changes. When the package name is different, do the following: 

1. Install the new version of EDB PgBouncer:

   ```shell
   dnf install edb-pgbouncer<xx>
   ```

1. Copy your desired configuration from the previous version of EDB PgBouncer. 

1. Stop and disable the previous version. 

1. Start and enable the new version. 

1. Test the new version to make sure it's running. If unsuccessful, begin again from Step 3. 

1. After successfully testing new version, remove the previous version with the following command: 

   ```shell
   dnf remove edb-pgbouncer<xx>
   ```

1. Clean up the modified files from the old version.
