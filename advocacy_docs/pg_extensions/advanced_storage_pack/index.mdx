EDB Advanced Storage Pack provides advanced storage options for PostgreSQL databases in the form of table access method (TAM) extensions. These storage options can enhance the performance and reliability of databases without requiring application changes.

For tables whose access patterns you know in advance, you might prefer a targeted TAM that makes different tradeoffs. For instance, if a given table in an application is INSERT-only and the rows never receive any updates, you can might consider using a specialized TAM for this table that has INSERT-specific optimizations.

EnterpriseDB offers two TAMs in the Advanced Storage Pack. 

## Autocluster 

The Autocluster TAM provides faster access to clustered data by keeping track of the last inserted row for any value in a side table. You can then add new rows to the same data blocks as previous rows, keeping the data clustered. This approach reduces access time to related data. To use this feature, keep rows with the same key values clustered together so that an index scan for a specific key can find all the rows close together. The scan doesn't need to retrieve as many table pages to satisfy the query.

## Refdata

The Refdata TAM is optimized for mostly static data, which contains an occasional INSERT and very few DELETE and UPDATE commands. For database schemas that use foreign keys to reference data, this TAM can provide performance gains of 5-10% and increased scalability. To use this feature, take an exclusive lock on the reference table whenever you modify it, blocking out concurrent modifications by any other session as well as modifications to tables that reference the table. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE department (
	department_id	SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
	department_name	TEXT
) USING refdata;

CREATE TABLE employee (
	...
	department_id	NOT NULL REFERENCES department(department_id)
);
```

The `employee` table is a standard heap table. Only the `department` table uses the `refdata` TAM. Inserts and updates of the employee table don't take out row-level locks on the department table, which saves query time. This approach also avoids the need to update the rows in the department table and avoids the need to write the referenced department table rows to disk and to the write-ahead log.

If updates to the `department` table are frequent, we recommend that you don't use the Refdata TAM because concurrent modifications to it and to the employee table are then blocked. If you make infrequent changes to the `department` table, speeding up frequent changes to the employee table and reducing write-ahead log traffic might be worth this cost.
